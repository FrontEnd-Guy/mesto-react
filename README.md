# Mesto (React)

## Overview

Porting [the Mesto project](https://github.com/FrontEnd-Guy/mesto) from vanilla JS to React

"Mesto" is an interactive page where you can add photos, delete them and like them. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project was created as part of my studies at [Yandex.Practicum](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/) on the course ["Web developer"](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/web/).

## Tools used

* React.js
* Hooks and Functional components
* React DevTools
* NPM
* GitHub
* Visual Studio Code

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
